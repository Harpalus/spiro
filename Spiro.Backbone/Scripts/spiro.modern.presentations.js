    // ABOUT THIS FILE:
    // The interfaces defined here permit the separation of the presentation layer from the
    // mechanics of spiro.modern, which use Backbone.js.  In the distribution, we provide
    // an implementation of the presentation layer using Handlebars templates, but it would
    // also be possible to write your presentation layer using Tags or Stickit or another
    // library.
